# BRIDGES
Building Resilient Integrated, Decarbonized Gas-Electric Systems (BRIDGES)

Version: 0.0

Author: Gregory Von Wald

Objective: To permit integrated design and operations optimization for 
system planning of integrated public-interest (i.e., gas and electric) energy systems
across time horizons with declining constraints on greenhouse gas emissions.
Model minimizes the present value of total system costs (investment plus operations)
across a multi-year investment time horizon, with co-optimized system operations 
simulated for a set of weighted, representative periods (e.g., days) 
composed of operational time steps (e.g., hours)
