# BRIDGES
Building Resilient Integrated, Decarbonized Gas-Electric Systems (BRIDGES)
Version: 0.0
Author: Gregory Von Wald
Objective: To permit integrated design and operations optimization for 
system planning of integrated public-interest (i.e., gas and electric) energy systems
across time horizons with declining constraints on greenhouse gas emissions.
Model minimizes the present value of total system costs (investment plus operations)
across a multi-year investment time horizon, with co-optimized system operations 
simulated for a set of weighted, representative periods (e.g., days) 
composed of operational time steps (e.g., hours)

## Useful commands for Sherlock
\begin{itemize}
    \item sbatch my_job.script (run batch script)
    \item squeue -u <user_name> (check job in queue)
    \item sh_part (view cluster partition)
    \item scancel <job_id> (cancels job)
\end{itemize}
